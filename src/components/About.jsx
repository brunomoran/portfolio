            Welcome! I&apos;m Bruno Mor√°n, a final year computer science student
            and currently working as a software engineer intern in Midokura.
            I&apos;m now looking to continue my professional career as a full
            time engineer while finishing my degree. I&apos;m always looking for
            new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in any aspect of
            my life.
