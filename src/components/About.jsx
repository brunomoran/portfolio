            Welcome! I&apos;m Bruno Mor√°n, a software engineer currently working at app2U 
            after completing my degree in Computer Science.
            Previously, I interned at Midokura, where I gained hands-on experience in
            real-world software development. I&apos;m passionate about technology, always eager
            to take on new challenges, and constantly looking for opportunities to learn and
            grow both personally and professionally.
